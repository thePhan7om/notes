There are two sticks which takes one hour to burn from one end to other.
The sticks do not burn at a constant rate i.e. some part may burn faster than others.
 You need to measure 45 minutes by using these two sticks and a lighter.

I have:
2 Sticks
1 Lighter

Need to messure 45 min
- Sticks do not burn constantly, impractical if I lost count 
- may take 50 min to burn 20 % and then fast burn the rest  so cant break the sticks

- Hit the sticks together at a constant rate to and count the 45 min
0 minutes – Light stick 1 on both sides and stick 2 on one side.
30 minutes – Stick 1 will be burnt out. Light the other end of stick 2.
45 minutes – Stick 2 will be burnt out.
- There for 45 minutes will have elasped
