Two persons are walking into a railway tunnel. Upon crossing 2/3rd of the tunnel, 
they saw train is coming from opposite direction. 
Each person ran for a different end of tunnel with speed of 10 km per hour. 
Fortunately, both persons escaped from the tunnel just right time i.e.. 
at the time train would have run through them. 
Assuming train was running with a constant speed and both persons reacted immediately, Find out speed of train.


-  1 tunnel of X length 
-  2 people 2/3 X into the tunnel
-  1 train outside the tunnel 
-  Both ran at 10kph
-  Both ran in oposite directions
-  The train JUST missed both of them

Before train approches:
-  person 1 covers 1/3X at 10kph 
-  person 2 covers 2/3X at 10kph
-  Train enters tunnel when person 2 is 1/3X from his exit
-  Train covers entire distance of tunnel in the same time person 2 covers 1/3
-  Trains speed is 3X person 2 
-  Trains speed is 30kph
