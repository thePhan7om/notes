There are 27 coins and a two-pan balance. All coins has same weight except for one,
 which is heavier than all others. All coins looks identical.
 What is the minimum number of weighing required to certainly find out heavier coin?
  
 - 27 coins
 - 2 scales
 - 1 heavy 
 
 I have an uneven number of coins
  
 If I left 1 coin out and weighed them 50:50 I would know which half the heavy coin was in
 - If both piles are the same the heavy coin is the exculded one
 - Assuming both piles are differnt weights I disguard the lighter pile, the heavier coin isnt there - weight 1
 - This leaves me with 13 coins one of which is heavy
 - if I remove another one at random I have 12 coins left on the scale. 
 - I distribute these evenly 6 on each side -- weight 2
 - as before if the are the same I removed the heavy one
 - if the piles are different again disguard the lighter pile
 - I know have 6 coins, there isnt an odd number to remove
 - so i spread them evenly -- weight 3
 - I disguard the ligher pile
 - I have 3 coins remaining, 
 - I remove one and spread the other 2 -- Weight 4
 - the Heavy coin is the one I removed or one of the other 2. 
 
 - Total Number of messures to find out -4
 
 
 *Correct Answer is 3, same logic but first pile should have been 9
